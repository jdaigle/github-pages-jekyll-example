First, let's say *"Hello world"* in Java:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

And then Scala:

```scala
object HelloWorld with Application {
    Console.println("Hello, World!");
}
```

With Application? Wait, what? Hmm... I don't care. Me has Python.
